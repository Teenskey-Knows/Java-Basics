 Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own; instead, they serve as a blueprint for other classes to be derived from. They can contain both concrete and abstract methods. Abstract methods are declared but have no implementation in the abstract class, and they must be implemented in the derived classes. Abstract classes can also have regular (concrete) methods that are already implemented.

Here's a step-by-step guide to understanding abstract classes in Java with code examples:

Step 1: Creating an Abstract Class
Let's start by creating an abstract class called Shape. We'll define an abstract method calculateArea() that represents the area of the shape:

java
Copy code
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method - no implementation here
    public abstract double calculateArea();

    // Concrete method
    public void displayArea() {
        System.out.println("Area: " + calculateArea());
    }
}
Step 2: Creating Concrete Classes
Now, we'll create two concrete classes Circle and Rectangle, which will extend the Shape abstract class:

java
Copy code
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}
Step 3: Using the Concrete Classes
Now that we have the Circle and Rectangle classes, we can use them to create objects and calculate their areas:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle circle = new Circle(5.0);
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(4.0, 3.0);

        circle.displayArea();    // Output: Area: 78.53981633974483
        rectangle.displayArea(); // Output: Area: 12.0
    }
}
Explanation:

The Shape class is declared abstract using the abstract keyword.
The calculateArea() method in the Shape class is abstract and has no implementation, as it depends on the shape of the concrete class.
The displayArea() method is a concrete method in the Shape class that can be called directly without any modifications in the concrete classes.
When you create an abstract class, you cannot create objects directly from it. Instead, you create objects of its concrete subclasses (like Circle and Rectangle in this example) to use their functionalities.

Abstract classes are useful when you want to define common behavior for a group of related classes while allowing each subclass to implement their specific behavior. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.
