class MyClass {
    // Instance variables and other methods go here

    // Constructor(s) - Use the same name as the class
    public MyClass() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    // You can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists (overloading)
    public MyClass(int someValue) {
        // Initialization code with 'someValue'

public class Constructor {

//     In Java, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It plays a crucial role in the process of object creation and ensures that the object is properly initialized before it can be used. Here are some key points about constructors and how they should be defined in Java:

// Importance of Constructors:

// Object Initialization: Constructors ensure that the object's state (instance variables) is properly set up when the object is created. It helps avoid instances where an object is created but left in an inconsistent or undefined state.

// Implicit Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is created using the new keyword. This means you don't have to explicitly call the constructor; it is called automatically during object instantiation.

// No Return Type: Constructors don't have a return type, not even void. Their purpose is solely to initialize the object.

// Overloading: Like other methods in Java, constructors can be overloaded, meaning you can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This allows you to create objects with different initialization setups.

// Default Constructor: If you don't provide any constructors in your class, Java will automatically create a default constructor with no arguments. However, if you define at least one constructor, the default constructor won't be created automatically.




    
}


//Parameterized Constructor:

// Constructors can take parameters, allowing you to initialize instance variables with specific values during object creation:


/* 
public class Person {
    private String name; 
    private int age;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getters and other methods go here
}



Person john = new Person("John", 30);
